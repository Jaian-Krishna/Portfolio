                <p>Final project coursework for Sixth Form. We were given the choice to find a problem, with a potential client, and apply a solution to that problem through developing a programme that can be used by the client. The problem I had chosen to fix concerned the lack of easy-to-use software, available to the students at the school I was studying at, that abstracted and demonstrated the Turing Machine model, while also allowing the students to develop their own programs within this model, which the program can demonstrate the execution of their program.</p>
            </div>

                <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Project Aims</h2>
                <p>The project aim was to provide an abstraction of a Turing Machine that is interactive with the user that can demonstrate to the user how a Turing Machine functions. This interaction will include a demonstration of the execution of a particular algorithm on a given value, demonstrating how the final result was reached. The algorithm can be coded in one of two ways, by either constructing a transition table, or by defining each transition rule following a specific syntax. Once either is constructed, they can be compiled, and the user can enter a value onto a tape, which the program can run the algorithm on, to achieve the result of the computation. </p>
                <p>This specification was designed to meet the clients needs, specifically a student who wishes to become more familiar with the functions and workings of a Turing Machine.</p>
                <p>My personal aims of this project were to gain a familiarity with working on a long term project, becoming confident in the skills required to set personal goals and understanding how to manage time and targets when undergoing a project of this magnitude, as well as the required skills needed to learn new concepts during development.  </p>

                <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Experience Gained</h2>
                <p>The experience undertaking this project provided me with a solid foundational understanding of project work. This was my first large project to have undertaken at that time, and through it I made many mistakes, and used techniques to solve problems that I was very proud of. I was able to learn from this and use it in the future towards working on other projects. </p>
