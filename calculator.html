            <p>A solo project assigned as part of the Software Engineering module during my second year at university. The task was to program a simple calculator able to use two different notations, standard form and reverse polish. During this development, Software Engineering techniques were to be used effectively, concerning the use of TDD, employment of programming standards, following effective design patterns, and use of a coding repository (in this project we used SVN) to name a few. This program was to be completed over the course of two months, which by the end, the end product should include the program itself, along with the coding repository including both the trunk and branches of the program during development and with its history of commits.</p>

            <p>The project provided a strong introduction to software engineering techniques, and an insight into the various conventions that should be followed for good software engineering practices. It additionally changed the approach I have taken towards programming, creating habits and practices that help boost the integrity of programs that I produce.</p>
