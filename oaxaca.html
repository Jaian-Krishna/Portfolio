                <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Project Background</h2>
                <p>During my second year at university, I was put in a team of 8 students, where we were tasked to create a website for a restaurant named Oaxaca. The website had a specification communicated to the team by a client who would attend scrum meetings frequently with the team to ensure that the team was producing software in line with the client’s expectations, and to communicate any changes to the project scope.</p>
                <p>During this Project, the team utilised a number of programs throughout the development. These include Trello for task management, GitHub as the coding repository, Microsoft Teams for communication, to name the programs that were used by each team member collectively. </p>

                <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Project Aims</h2>
                <p>
                    The aim of the project was not so much focused on gaining experience in the individual programming aspect of the project, however, more focus was placed on the experience of working together programming as a team, and the communications involved in effectively producing a program in an efficient and functional manner. This involves becoming familiar with using coding repositories, and the conventions that should be followed in this regard to allow for effective communications during the development, as well gaining a familiarity with communicating with the team directly when working together towards a common target.

                <p>
                    My role in this project was based largely on the implementation of the front end for the final deliverable. During development I worked largely on the design, and implementation of this using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, along with other members of the team, and communicated largely with the team designated with designing the back end to ensure compatibility.

                <p>
                    The experience the project provided me with was invaluable, projects I have worked on in a team prior to this project provided a good foundational experience with communication in coding together, however, this project provided a far more comprehensive, and applicable to the real-world development of skills. This project allowed me to become more familiar with the techniques and potential software applications to working in a team environment.

                        The final grade received for the group project as marked by my university was an A (highest possible grade) and received the following feedback:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Final Product
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Neat and well indented code. No evidence of structured tests. There exists a directory structure but it could be better named and organized. There is clear separation of functionality. There is a decoupling of backend and frontend. The code is well commented. Coding conventions have been followed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        UI
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The UI is good and has good aesthetics. UI demonstrates most user stories mentioned and covers most basic functionality. Some functionality such as filtering food by allergens was not demonstrated. Easy to use clear functionality. Video showed that there are minor synchronizing bugs but otherwise all functionality seem to be working. The interface to add and remove items is simple. For example it does not let you add a non-existing item with details such as image, allergens etc.”
