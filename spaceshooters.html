              <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Project Background</h2>
              <p>During the first year of my studies at university, we were tasked with the project to produce a game and to present this game to a group large audience once the deadline for the game was passed. The team was tasked with coming up with the specifications of the game, and designing it, as well as implementing the entire game in Python. During the development of the project, the team would hold frequent meetings and discuss various issues faced, as well as plans for the future of the project, such as new task designations and any changes needed to be made to meet deadlines. The entire project lasted over the course of two months.</p>

              <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Project Aims</h2>
              <p>
                  The aim of the project was to introduce two main concepts, an introduction to working as a team, and the skills required to, as a team, adopt new programming concepts as our chosen specification for the project was outlined by the team.

              <h2 class="text-center mb-4">My Role</h2>
              <p>
                  My role during the project was designated by the team to be the team leader. This involved hosting, and scheduling meetings, as well as recording all plans, and designating roles to the individual members in the group, setting deadlines for each task. On top of this, I also produced all of the artwork for the game, and coded a large portion of the game, including the player controls, the movement physics of the player character, the scoring system, as well as refactoring the entire code each week.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Additionally, once the project was completed, I was designated to present the entire project, and a presentation I made regarding the project to a large group of students and a professor running the module.

              <p>
                  The project was an enriching experience for me, since this was the first time I had undertaken a project of this scale in a team, as well as being the team leader for such a project. The project provided a firm introduction to working as a team towards a common goal, which served as a solid foundation for my future experiences working as a team in a more formal setting.

                  The project received an A (highest possible mark for this module), which includes the feedback from other students reviewing the presentation I had given for this project.
